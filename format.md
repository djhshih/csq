# Compact Sequence and Quality Format

## Feature specification

* overall aim: to be superior to gzip for compressing fastq files in most aspects
* streaming: one-pass read
* fast linear access; reasonable random access
* fast decompression; reasonable compression
* low memory footprint
* early detection of truncated data
* data integrity check and error recovery with limited data loss
* support for short or long reads of fixed or variable length
* support for 'N' bases
* optional lossy compression of quality score into 16 bins

## Format specification

- all multi-byte values are little endian
- each line contains: size of data in bytes (blank if variable), data type, and description
- `[a]` denotes array of elements of type `a`; empty arrays are skipped

- each page contains only one type of data; possible page types: names, sequenes, qualities
- max page body size before compression is 64 kb (cannot be increased without changing u16 types)
- pages may be encoded and/or compressed; they are then written back-to-back within a block until maximum block size
- default maximum block size is 2048 kb
- long sequence and quality may be split into multiple pages (e.g. PacBio data);
  first page is `fresh` and remaining are `continued`
- page types are interleaved in the order: names, sequences, qualities
- continuation pages are to be concatenated with the last page of the same type
- example read name schema: `@{enum}:{u16}:{enum}:{u8}:{uint}:{uint}:{uint} {u8}:{char}:{u16}:{str}`
- to avoid vector resizing, N bases are replaced by A, but they will be masked over by N during decompression
- sequencing encoding `bitpack2`: bitpacked in 2 bit encoding (00: A, 01: C, 10: G, 11: T)
- quality encoding `lossy_bitpack4`: binned into 16 bins and bitpacked in 4 bits

## Types



## Remarks

- page structure limits memory footprint and data loss after corruption; it also helps random access
- block structure promotes fast sequential IO while allowing small page size
- index structures are stored in the footer, so that a reader may skip them
