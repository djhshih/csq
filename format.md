# Compact Sequence and Quality Format

## Feature specification

* overall aim: to be superior to gzip for compressing fastq files in most aspects
* streaming: one-pass read
* fast linear access; reasonable random access
* fast decompression; reasonable compression
* low memory footprint
* early detection of truncated data
* data integrity check and error recovery with limited data loss
* support for short or long reads of fixed or variable length
* support for 'N' bases
* optional lossy compression of quality score into 16 bins

## Format specification

- all multi-byte values are little endian
- each line contains: size of data in bytes (blank if variable), data type, and description
- `[a]` denotes array of elements of type `a`; empty arrays are skipped

```

- each page contains only one type of data; possible page types: names, sequenes, qualities
- max page body size before compression is 64 kb (cannot be increased without changing u16 types)
- pages may be encoded and/or compressed; they are then written back-to-back within a block until maximum block size
- default maximum block size is 2048 kb
- long sequence and quality may be split into multiple pages (e.g. PacBio data);
  first page is `fresh` and remaining are `continued`
- page types are interleaved in the order: names, sequences, qualities
- continuation pages are to be concatenated with the last page of the same type
- example read name schema: `@{machine}:{run}:{cell}:{lane}:{tile}:{x}:{y} {pair}:{filtered}:{flags}:{index}`
- to avoid vector resizing, N bases are replaced by A, but they will be masked over by N during decompression
- sequencing encoding `bitpack2`: bitpacked in 2 bit encoding (00: A, 01: C, 10: G, 11: T)
- quality encoding `lossy_bitpack4`: binned into 16 bins and bitpacked in 4 bits
- name component type enum: `u8 u16 u32 u64 uint i8 i16 i32 i64 int f32 f64 char str enum index const`
- writer needs to check that hash of read id is unique; switch to next hashing function if collision detected

## Remarks

- page structure limits memory footprint and data loss after corruption; it also helps random access
- block structure promotes fast sequential IO while allowing small page size
- index structures are stored in the footer, so that a reader may skip them

## Under consideration

- add block index and page index indicating minimum and maximum values of each field of the read name,
  so that reads with specific values for sorted fields may be found by bisection searh, and
  filtering based on field values can skip reading blocks and pages whose field range
  fall outside query field values
