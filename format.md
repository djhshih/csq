# Compact Sequence and Quality Format

## Feature specification

* streaming: one-pass read
* fast linear access; reasonable random access
* fast decoding; reasonable compression
* low memory requirement
* data integrity check and error recovery with limited data loss
* support short or long reads of fixed or variable length
* support 'N' bases
* optional lossy compression of quality score into 16 bins
* superior to gzip in most aspects

## Format specification

All multi-byte values are little endian.

## Comments

- each page contains only one type of data (names, sequences, or qualities)
- reads are sorted by implicit read number
- sequence and quality may be split into multiple blocks (e.g. PacBio data)
- compressed pages are packed into block until target size

Handling of N

option 1
- quality of 1 indicates sequence = N
- quality of 0 can be reserved for special purpose...

option 2
- to avoid vector resizing, N bases are replaced by A, but they will be masked over by N during decompression.
- number of N blocks
- (start of N block, end of N block)
